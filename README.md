# 21_Game

A simple web game of 21. This is nothing like blackjack by the way. Sorry to disappoint.
## Rules

21 Is a game where you can choose numbers 1-3 against a computer or another player. Goal of the game is for the winner to reach 21 first:

## Development

I made this game with HTML, SASS and vanilla javascript. Everything was made in the app.js file as the app wasn't supposed to get too large. I'm still hoping to turn this into a modular architecture in the future.

This was also my first trivial experience with AI, it was a very fun way to learn about AI with much of the complexity lifted.

### Hope you enjoy this!
